# Selection Sort

This is a Python implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm. It sorts an array of elements in either ascending or descending order based on the user's input.

## Usage

1. Run the script.
2. Enter the number of elements in the array.
3. Enter each element one by one.
4. Specify the order of sorting (asc/desc).
5. The script will display the original array and the sorted array.

## Example

```python
Enter number of elements: 5
Enter element: 9
Enter element: 2
Enter element: 7
Enter element: 4
Enter element: 1
Enter order of sorting (asc/desc): asc
Original Array:  [9, 2, 7, 4, 1]
Sorted array: [1, 2, 4, 7, 9]
