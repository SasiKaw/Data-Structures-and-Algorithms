# Bubble Sort

This repository contains an implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm in Python.

## Algorithm Description

Bubble Sort is a simple comparison-based sorting algorithm. It repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. The pass through the list is repeated until the list is sorted.

## Usage

To use the Bubble Sort algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Define an array of elements to be sorted.
2. Call the `bubbleSort` function, passing the array as an argument.
3. The function will return the sorted array.

Example usage:
# Example usage:
array = [4, 2, 7, 1, 9, 5]
sorted_array = bubbleSort(array)
print(sorted_array)
